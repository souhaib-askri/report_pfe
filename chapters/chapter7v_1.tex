\chapter[Sprint 4]{Study and Implementation of Sprint 4: Community Interaction \& Profile Management}

\section{Introduction}

Sprint 4 focuses on building a vibrant community ecosystem and profile management capabilities. This sprint introduces community interaction features enabling users to engage through comments, likes, and collaborative copying mechanisms, alongside robust profile management functionality for showcasing work effectively.

The community features transform the platform from a diagramming tool into a collaborative workspace where users discover, learn from, and build upon each other's work.

\section{Sprint Planning}

\subsection{Objectives and Backlog}

Sprint 4 objectives include developing community exploration, project interaction features, comment management, project copying functionality, and comprehensive profile management.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Key Use Cases Description}

\textbf{Explore Community:} Users and visitors browse public projects with filtering and search capabilities to discover interesting content and platform offerings.

\textbf{Comment Management:} Authenticated users can create, update, and delete comments on projects, providing feedback and engaging in community discussions with full CRUD operations.

\textbf{Project Interactions:} Users can like/unlike projects and comments to show appreciation and engage with community content, with real-time UI updates.

\textbf{Project Copying:} Users can copy community projects to their workspace for learning and building upon others' work, with proper attribution and workspace integration.

\subsection{Profile Management Features}
